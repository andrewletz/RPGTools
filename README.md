A new and rewarding way to experience resource gathering in Minecraft.

## Status

The plugin is nearing completion, but in its current state is still unusable. Please do not attempt to use this on a public server unless you plan on fixing all the big issues :)
I would also recommend waiting to use any code until first release, as it may be buggy.

## Dependencies

This plugin is designed to be used on Spigot for Minecraft version 1.12.1 (as of 12/13/2017).

There are no other plugin dependencies.

## Contributing

If you have a good idea or feature that you can implement correctly I would love to see it! However, it may be difficult to integrate until the base systems are completed settled.

## License

RPGTools is under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). Please see [the license file](LICENSE) for more information.

[tl;dr](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license) you can do whatever you want as long as you include the original copyright and license notice in any copy of the software/source.

I would also appreciate a credit in your code/project description if you find something helpful within this repository.
